# youtube_video_downloader


This Python project allows you to download YouTube videos by providing the video link as a command-line argument. It utilizes the pytube library to fetch video information and download the highest resolution video stream available for the specified YouTube link. The downloaded video is saved in the "downloaded_video" directory within the project folder.

First of all run this code in your terminal: pip install pytube <br>
Then run the code in the sequence:  python video_downloader.py <youtube video link>
create a folder named downloaded_video
